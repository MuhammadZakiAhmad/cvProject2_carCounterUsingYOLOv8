Computer Vision Project 2: Smart Car Detection and Counting System


Quenching my thirst for Computer Vision applications I have completed a very useful project, a system that can detect cars in a region of interest and count their frequency. This version of the project is limited to Cars but can easily be extended to all type of vehicles.


Project Highlights:

📌 Object Detection: We utilize YOLO (You Only Look Once) for precise object detection, enabling us to identify and track vehicles in real-time video streams.

🛣️ Region of Interest (ROI): A specific area of the frame is defined as the ROI, where we accurately count vehicles as they pass through.

🔢 Object Tracking: The system employs advanced object tracking techniques to follow vehicles as they move across the frame seamlessly.

📊 Counting and Visualization: Vehicle counts are tallied with precision, and the results are displayed in real-time on the video stream.

💡 Applications: Beyond the project, this technology can be applied to various fields, from traffic monitoring to parking management, contributing to smarter and more efficient urban environments.

🔗 Connect with Me: If you share a passion for Computer Vision or are interested in exploring its limitless possibilities, let's connect! Together, we can quench our thirst for knowledge and innovation.
